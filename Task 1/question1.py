### Implementing code via integer data types
number1=int(input("Enter the first number:"))      //taking input from user for first number
number2=int(input("Enter the second number:"))     //taking input from user for second number
print("sum of two numbers",number1+number2)        //Addition of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("difference of two numbers",number1-number2) //subtraction of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("product of two numbers",number1*number2)    //multiplication of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("comparison between two numbers")            //comparison of two the numbers which were taken from user via if-else statement 
if(number1>number2):
    print("number1 is greater than number2")
else:
    print("number2 is greater than number2")

### Implementing code via float data types
number1=float(input("Enter the first number:"))    //taking input from user for first number
number2=float(input("Enter the second number:"))   //taking input from user for second number
print("sum of two numbers",number1+number2)        //Addition of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("difference of two numbers",number1-number2) //subtraction of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("product of two numbers",number1*number2)    //multiplication of two the numbers which were taken from user
print("comparison between two numbers")            //comparison of two the numbers which were taken from user via if-else statement 
if(number1>number2):
    print("number1 is greater than number2")
else:
    print("number2 is greater than number2")
