**1. Why is list used?**

Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python. 
A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects.
Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
It facilitates accessing of values by indexing , values can be easily updated or removed with indexing method.
Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.

**2.How do lists and sets differ?**
- list display values as given by the user, but sets displays values in random fashion.
- list can contain duplicate values whereas set cannot.
- list values can be accessed by indexing whereas values in sets do not have any particular indexes.
- list are initialized in ***square brackets*** whereas sets are initialized in  ***curly braces***.
- sets facilitates functions such as union, intersection, difference whereas list do not have these.

**3.Application of dictionaries with a real world example.**

Storing data in  dictionaries of dictionaries, which is kind of like a table, useful for storing large amount of data like in banks, its access is easy and less chances
of loosing data corresponding to an individual,easy to update and remove data.
