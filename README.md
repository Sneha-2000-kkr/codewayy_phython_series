## INTRODUCTION
Hello everyone up there:smile:!!!

>My self **Sneha Singh**, a undergraduate Btech CSE 3rd year student from **Banasthali Vidyapeeth**.
>This repository contains Python Language related task.
### Task 1:
- A program in Python which would include some code working with integers and float variables.
- a program in Python in which you should display your following details:
  -  Full Name( String concatenation should be used)
  -  College name with address (Use string concatenation)
  -  Initialize marks of 5 different subjects with good variable names.
  -  Calculate and display the total marks, percentage.
  
### Task 2:
  1. Write a program in Python which should contain at least 7 different methods
      of list, tuples, sets, dictionaries. (Program should be written in 4 different .py
      for each of them).
  2. Create a txt file and write the answers to the following questions in it.
      - Why is list used?
      - How do lists and sets differ?
      - Application of dictionaries with a real world example.
      
### Task 3:
 1. Write a program in python which should include 5 different functions for the
following use:
   - Function should return your full name
   - Function should return your total marks
   - Function to return your percentages on basis of marks
   - Function should return your grade with the following criteria:
     - score >= 95 : "A"
     - score >= 85 && score<=95 : "B"
     - score >= 75 && score<=85 : "C"
     - score >= 65 && score<=75 : "D"
  - Function to print all the details of a student, so here this function
should call all other functions to print the name, marks, grades,
percentage.
2. Write a program in Python to calculate the length of two strings by
concatenating them.
3. Write a program in Python to print all the numbers till 10 except 3, 7 using
for and while loop.

### Task 4:
1. Write a program in Python which would print all the prime numbers in a n*n
matrix.
2. Write a program in python which would contain a main.py file and should
import other python files as modules and make the use of all the functions
defined in the module, the different files should have the following function
definition:
- A python file which should have a function to calculate the square of a
number, find the maximum of a number in a list, minimum of a
number in a list. Sum of all numbers in a list. (Not allowed to use
default python function)
- A python file which should have a function to find the middle
character of a string, count the number of vowels in a string, calculate
the length of the string, calculate the number of words in a string.
- A python file which should show the use of all logical operators of
python as different function definitions.


### Task 5:
1. Write a program in Python which makes use of the Python error handling,
your program should include try, catch, raise keyword.
2. Write a program in Python which makes use of the different match
functions(min 3) and the sort function for list, tuples, sets etc.
3. Write a program in Python to read a text file and print it’s content.
4. Write a program in Python which should take a string of 3-4 lines and write
it to a txt file.


### Task 6:
Q1 . Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should
have one parameter: speed.
If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver
one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if
the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License
suspended”

Q2. Write a Python program to remove an empty tuple(s) from a list of tuples.
Sample data: [(),(), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
Expected output: [('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), 'd']

Q3. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of
upper case letters and lower case letters.

Q4. Find all occurrences of “at” in given string ignoring the case(take string as
input from user.)

Q5. Create a function to count number of words in a sentence (Take input from
user)

Q6: A positive integer, n, is said to be perfect if the sum of its proper divisors
equals the number itself. (Proper divisors include 1 but not the number itself.) If
this sum is less than n, the number is deficient, and if the sum is greater than n,
the number is abundant.
Use the function name and the argument as:

**def findType(n):**

The Function should return 1 if the given integer is a deficient number, return 0
if it is a perfect number and return -1 if it is a abundant number.

Q7: Create a function named check_marks.
This method checks whether the marks is greater than or equal to 90 and if it is
greater than or equal to 90, the method returns True.
If the marks is less than 90, a custom Exception named **NotEligibleException** is
raised and an appropriate message as shown in the sample output is displayed.


### Task 7:
1. Write a program using Python class and objects which should have 5 different functions
and should create the 5 different instances of that class and print the details of all the
instances. The function details are given below:
- To display the full name
- To display the college and branch
- Display the total marks
- Total percentage of marks
- And calculate the grade
