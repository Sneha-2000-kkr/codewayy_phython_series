  -  Full Name( String concatenation should be used)
  -  College name with address (Use string concatenation)
  -  Initialize marks of 5 different subjects with good variable names.
  -  Calculate and display the total marks, percentage.
  
  ### Task 2:
  1. Write a program in Python which should contain at least 7 different methods
      of list, tuples, sets, dictionaries. (Program should be written in 4 different .py
      for each of them).
  2. Create a txt file and write the answers to the following questions in it.

      - How do lists and sets differ?
      - Application of dictionaries with a real world example.

     - score >= 65 && score<=75 : "D"
  - Function to print all the details of a student, so here this function
should call all other functions to print the name, marks, grades,
percentage.
