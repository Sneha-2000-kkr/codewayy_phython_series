## INTRODUCTION
Hello everyone up there:smile:!!!

>My self **Sneha Singh**, a undergraduate Btech CSE 3rd year student from **Banasthali Vidyapeeth**.
>This repository contains Python Language related task.
### Task 1:
- A program in Python which would include some code working with integers and float variables.
- a program in Python in which you should display your following details:
  -  Full Name( String concatenation should be used)
  -  College name with address (Use string concatenation)
  -  Initialize marks of 5 different subjects with good variable names.
  -  Calculate and display the total marks, percentage.
  
### Task 2:
  1. Write a program in Python which should contain at least 7 different methods
      of list, tuples, sets, dictionaries. (Program should be written in 4 different .py
      for each of them).
  2. Create a txt file and write the answers to the following questions in it.
      - Why is list used?
      - How do lists and sets differ?
      - Application of dictionaries with a real world example.
      
### Task 3:
 1. Write a program in python which should include 5 different functions for the
following use:
   - Function should return your full name
   - Function should return your total marks
   - Function to return your percentages on basis of marks
   - Function should return your grade with the following criteria:
     - score >= 95 : "A"
     - score >= 85 && score<=95 : "B"
     - score >= 75 && score<=85 : "C"
     - score >= 65 && score<=75 : "D"
  - Function to print all the details of a student, so here this function
should call all other functions to print the name, marks, grades,
percentage.
2. Write a program in Python to calculate the length of two strings by
concatenating them.
3. Write a program in Python to print all the numbers till 10 except 3, 7 using
for and while loop.

### Task 4:
1. Write a program in Python which would print all the prime numbers in a n*n
matrix.
2. Write a program in python which would contain a main.py file and should
import other python files as modules and make the use of all the functions
defined in the module, the different files should have the following function
definition:
- A python file which should have a function to calculate the square of a
number, find the maximum of a number in a list, minimum of a
number in a list. Sum of all numbers in a list. (Not allowed to use
default python function)
- A python file which should have a function to find the middle
character of a string, count the number of vowels in a string, calculate
the length of the string, calculate the number of words in a string.
- A python file which should show the use of all logical operators of
python as different function definitions.


### Task 5:
1. Write a program in Python which makes use of the Python error handling,
your program should include try, catch, raise keyword.
2. Write a program in Python which makes use of the different match
functions(min 3) and the sort function for list, tuples, sets etc.
3. Write a program in Python to read a text file and print itâ€™s content.
4. Write a program in Python which should take a string of 3-4 lines and write
it to a txt file.
